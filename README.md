Introduction to API Reconnaissance

1. In order to target APIs, you must first be able to find them. 

2. Partner APIs are intended to be used exclusively by partners of the provider. These might be harder to find if you are not a partner. Partner APIs may be         documented, but documentation is often limited to the partner.

3. Private APIs are intended for use, privately, within an organization. These APIs are often documented less than partner APIS, if at all, and if any documentation exists it is even harder to find.
