Introduction to API Reconnaissance

1. In order to target APIs, you must first be able to find them. passive and active reconnaissance techniques

2. Partner APIs are intended to be used exclusively by partners of the provider. These might be harder to find if you are not a partner. Partner APIs may be         documented, but documentation is often limited to the partner.

3. Private APIs are intended for use, privately, within an organization. These APIs are often documented less than partner APIS, if at all, and if any documentation exists it is even harder to find.

4. APIs meant for consumer use are meant to be easily discovered. Typically, the API provider will market their API to developers who want to be consumers. So, it will often be very easy to find APIs, just by using a web application as an end-user. The goal here is to find APIs to attack and this can be accomplished by discovering the API itself or the API documentation.
 

One of the most obvious indicators of an API would be through information gathered using third-Party Sources like Github and API directories.
